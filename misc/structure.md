# Structure

## Introduction

- Formulation and history of H10
- Table describing central notions as algebraic object and model theoretic ones

| Algebraic          | Language of rings |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| polynomial         | relation          |
| root of polynomial | diophantine set   |
| etc.               |                   |

## Prerequisites and central notions

### Prerequisites from theoretical computer science

#### Definitions

- Turing machine
- Decidability, semi-decidability/computationally enumerable
    - why the 2nd is the best we can hope for
    - Example: (Prop. 4.5, @Koenigsmann2014)
- Encoding, Cantor pairing function
- Diophantine relations/sets

### Prerequisites from number theory

#### Definitions

- (Class number $c_k$)
- Abelian extension

### Theorems

- Minkowski's theorem [@Milne2017, Thm. 4.19]
- Dirichlet's unit theorem [@Milne2017, Thm. 5.1]
- Local-Global-Principle/Hasse–Minkowski-Theorem [@Meara2000, §66]

## Important techniques

1. Conjunctions and disjunctions of diophantine relations
2. $x ≠ 0$ is diophantine
2. ‘Going all the way up’ [@Shlapentokh2000]
3. ‘Going up and then down’ [@Shlapentokh2000]
