# Decidability and Hilbert's 10th problem over number rings

This is document is loosely based on a talk by @Koenigsmann2014.

Let $K$ be a number field with ring of integers $\mathcal O_K$, then Hilbert's 10th problem is unsolvable over $\mathcal O_K$

1. if $K ≠ ℚ$ is totally real [@Denef1975; @Denef1980],
2. if $K$ is a quadratic extension of a totally real number field [@Denef1978],
3. if $[K : ℚ] ≥ 3$ and $K$ has exactly one pair of non-real embeddings [@Pheidas1988; @Shlapentokh1989] [^0b6b51d1],
4. if $K$ is a subfield of a field with one of the properties above [@Shapiro1989], or
5. if $K / ℚ$ is abelian [@Shapiro1989].
