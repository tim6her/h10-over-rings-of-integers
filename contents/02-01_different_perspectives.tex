In 1900, David Hilbert held his famous lecture before the \emph{Second
International Congress of Mathematicians} in Paris. The lecture entitled
\begin{german}\enquote{Mathematische Probleme}\end{german} contained 23
mathematical problems left for the 20th century to solve.

    Given a Diophantine equation with any number of unknown quantities and with rational integral numerical coefficients: To devise a process according to which it can be determined by a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.
\end{quotation}

A \emph{Diophantine equation} is of the form
%
\[ p(x_1, …, x_n) = 0 \]
%
for some polynomial $p ∈ ℤ[X_1, …, X_n]$, allowing only solutions $α_1,…,α_n ∈ ℤ$.


\begin{defin}
    Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unit. A set $S \subseteq R^n$ is said to
    be \emph{Diophantine} if there exists a polynomial $p ∈ R[X_1,…,X_n,
    Y_1,…,Y_m]$ ($m ≥ 0$\footnote{If $m = 0$, one interprets this as $p ∈
    R[X_1,…,X_n]$}) such that

    \[ (α_1,…,α_n) ∈ S \Leftrightarrow ∃ β_1,…,β_m ∈ R: p(α_1,…,α_n,β_1,…,β_m) = 0 \]
\end{defin}

A polynomial $p ∈ R[X_1, …, X_n]$ as above defines $n$ relations $\rel{p}_i$ by
\[
  \rel{p}(α_1, …, α_i)  \Leftrightarrow
   ∃ β_1, …, β_{n - i} ∈ R : p(α_1, …, α_i, β_1, …, β_{i - n}) = 0 \quad
   1 ≤ i ≤ n.
\]
In this sense a set $S \subseteq R^i$ is Diophantine if there exists a
polynomial $p ∈ R[X_1, …, X_n]$ such that for each $\mathbf α ∈ S$ there exists
a $\mathbf β ∈ R^{n - i}$ that is related to $\mathbf α$ via $\rel p_i$.

Viewing $n$-ary relations as subsets of $R^n$, I will sometimes refer to
Diophantine sets as \emph{Diophantine relations}. A function $R^n → R^m$ is
called Diophantine if it is Diophantine viewed as a relation.

\begin{exam}
  \begin{exlist}
    \item Let $R$ be an integral domain.
    Then every finite subset $S$ of $R$ is Diophantine, because the roots of
    \[
      p(X) := \prod_{s ∈ S} (X - s)
    \]
    are precisely the elements of $S$.

    \item The set of composite numbers is Diophantine over $ℕ$, as $x ∈ ℕ$ is
    composite if and only if
    \[
      ∃ y_1, y_2 ∈ ℕ : x = (y_1 + 2) (y_2 + 2).
    \]
    Here adding $2$ to $y_1$ and $y_2$ ensures, that both factors are greater
    than $1$. Choosing
    \[
      p (X, Y_1, Y_2) := X - (Y_1 + 2)(Y_2 + 2)
    \]
    yields the claim.

    \item The usual order relation $≤$ on $ℕ$ is Diophantine over $ℕ$.
    Indeed $x_1 ≤ x_2$ in $ℕ$ if and only if
    \[
      ∃ y ∈ ℕ : x_1 + y  = x_2.
    \]

    \item Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unit. Then divisibility in $R$ is
    Diophantine. Indeed $x_1 \mid x_2$ in $R$ precisely if
    \[
      ∃ y ∈ R : x_1 y = x_2.
    \]

    \item Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unit. Then $R \setminus \set{0}$ is
    Diophantine over $R$.

    \item \label{ex:N is Diophantine over Z}
    Each non-negative integer $x$ is the sum of four squares and as a consequence
    \[
      x ∈ ℕ ⇔ ∃y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4∈ℤ: y_1^2 + y_2^2 + y_3^2 + y_4^2 - x = 0.
    \]
    is a Diophantine definition of $ℕ$ over $ℤ$. A full proof of the claim using \cref{thm:Minkowski} is given in \cite[Remark 4.20]{Milne2017}.

Let $Σ_{ring} = \set{+,\cdot; 0, 1}$ be the signature of rings and let
$\mathfrak{Z} = ⟨ℤ; +^\mathfrak{Z}, \cdot^\mathfrak{Z}; 0^\mathfrak{Z},
1^\mathfrak{Z}⟩$ denote the integers as $Σ_{ring}$-structure. Then \textsc{H10}
asks whether the existential positive theory $\mathtt{Th}_{∃+}(\mathfrak{Z})$ is
decidable. That is the theory of $\mathfrak{Z}$ containing only fully
existentially quantified atomic formulas or conjunctions---no negations,
disjunctions or universal quantifiers.

This claim can be justified by observing that each non-negative integer $n$ can
be expressed as
\[
  \underbrace{1 + 1 + … + 1}_{n\text{-times}}.
\]
So the question whether $X_1 - (X_2 + 2) (X_3 + 2)$ has integral roots is
equivalent to asking whether
\[
  \mathfrak Z \models ∃ x_1 ∃ x_2 ∃ x_3\; x_1 \doteq (x_2 + 1 + 1) \cdot (x_3 + 1 + 1).
\]
We will see in \cref{lem:intersections and unions} that for certain integral
domains including $\mathfrak Z$ conjunctions of multiple polynomial equations
can be effectively translated to a single polynomial equation.

The beauty of this approach is that it directly gives rise to generalisations of
Hilbert's tenth problem. For example one can exchange the ring structure
$\mathfrak Z$ by some other ring. Even uncountable rings like $\mathfrak C = ⟨ℂ;
+^{\mathfrak C}, \cdot^{\mathfrak C}; 0^{\mathfrak C},
1^{\mathfrak C}⟩$ are possible, as $Σ_{ring}$ is finite and therefore
each sentence in $\mathtt{Th}_{∃+}(\mathfrak{C})$ can be encoded by its
Gödelisation or---as it was done when typesetting this thesis---by the
concatenation of the \textsc{UTF-8} encodings of the symbols. A second approach
for generalisation is exchanging $Σ_{ring}$ by some other at most
countable signature. Then one is in the realm of constraint satisfaction
problems. Or one could consider the full first order theory of $\mathfrak Z$.
Then Gödel's first incompleteness theorem gives a negative answer to the
question, whether $\mathtt{Th}(\mathfrak Z)$ is decidable.

I will use the second approach and replace $Σ_{ring}=\set{+, \cdot;
0, 1}$ by the signature $Σ_{ring}^* = \set{+, \cdot; 0, 1, η \mid η
∈ ℕ}$ where one adds countably many constants representing the elements unequal
to $0$ and $1$ of a countable ring with unit $R$.

Throughout this thesis I will mostly concern myself with the case where $K$ is
an algebraic number field and $\algint$ is its ring of integers over $ℤ$.
Setting $\mathfrak{O} = ⟨\algint; +^{\mathfrak{O}},
\cdot^{\mathfrak{O}}; η \mid η ∈ \algint⟩$, I understand by Hilbert's tenth
problem (\textsc{H10}) over $\algint$ the following problem.

\begin{quote}
  Is there a Turing machine $\mathbb A$ that decides $\mathtt{Th}_{∃+} (\mathfrak O)$ i.e.
  \[
    \mathbb A (x) =
      \begin{cases}
        \one & \text{if } ∃ ϕ ∈  \mathtt{Th}_{∃+} (\mathfrak O) : \enc{ϕ} = x \\
        \zer & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}?
  \]
\end{quote}

Using the notion of computable rings it will be easy to see that
$\mathtt{Th}_{∃+}(\mathfrak O)$ is semi-decidable for all number fields $K$.
However, it is not known for all number fields, whether the existential positive
theory is undecidable. In the subsequent sections I will prove the
undecidability of \textsc{H10} over selected number fields $K$.

Considering the full first order theory of $\mathfrak O$ it is a result of
\textcite{Robinson1959} that $\mathtt{Th}(\mathfrak O)$ is undecidable. However,
\textcite{Rumely1986} proved that \textsc{H10} is solvable over $\mathcal
O$ the ring of all algebraic integers. \Textcite{Dries1988}
extended this result to the full first order theory of $\mathcal O$.

Probably the most prominent open problem in this area is the case of $ℚ$. A
positive answer to \textsc{H10} over $ℚ$ would imply that there is a universal
algorithm deciding whether a variety over $ℚ$ has a rational point. By giving a
first order definition of $ℤ$ over $ℚ$, \textcite{Robinson1949} could derive the
undecidability of the full first order theory $\mathtt{Th}(ℚ)$ from the
undecidability of the theory of $ℤ$. But Robinson's definition involves universal quantifiers and can not be used for inferring to \textsc{H10}.
\Textcite{Park2013} generalises this result by providing a universal first order definition for $\algint$ over an arbitrary number field $K$.
