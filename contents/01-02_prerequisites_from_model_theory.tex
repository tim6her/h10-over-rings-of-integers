The idea of model theory is to differentiate between the statements we can make
about mathematical objects and the implementation of these mathematical objects.
We will define \emph{languages} and their syntax and will describe what it means
for a mathematical object to \emph{model a theory}. In this section I will
closely follow Chapter 1 of the textbook \cite{Marker2002}.

Informally, a first-order formula is just a string of symbols that signify
distinguished constants, functions, and relations. We demand that a formula is
well-behaved according to the interpretability of constants, functions, and
relations. We do however not make any assumptions on the implementation of these
symbols. So a formula captures the \emph{syntax} of a collection of mathematical
objects. A model on the other hand is describes the \emph{semantics} of an
object. It gives concrete interpretation of the symbols of a language and tells
us, how the formulae are to be understood.

\begin{defin}
  A \emph{language} \(\lang\) is a quadruple \((\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{R},
  \mathcal{C}, ar: \mathcal{F} ∪ \mathcal{R} → ℕ \setminus \set{0})\), where
  \(\mathcal{F}\) is a set of function symbols, \(\mathcal{R}\) is a set of
  relation symbols, and \(\mathcal{C}\) is a set of constant symbols, such that
  all of these sets are pair-wise disjoint. The function \(ar: \mathcal{F} ∪
  \mathcal{R} → ℕ\) assigns to every function symbol \(f ∈ \mathcal{F}\) and
  every relation symbol \(R ∈ \mathcal{R}\) the \emph{arity} \(n_f\) and \(n_R\)
  respectively.
\end{defin}

By the the arity \(n_f\) of a function symbol \(f\) we describe that \(f\)
should eventually be interpreted as a function on \(n_f\) variables.
Analogously, the arity \(n_R\) of a relation symbol \(R\) describes that \(R\)
will denote an \(n_R\)-ary relation.

It is customary to denote the language \(\lang = (\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{R},
\mathcal{C}, ar: \mathcal{F} ∪ \mathcal{R} → ℕ \setminus \set{0})\) by
\[
  \lang = \set{f ∈ \mathcal{F}; R ∈ \mathcal{R}; c ∈ \mathcal{C}}
\]
and thereby drop the arity function from the notation.

\begin{exam}
  Examples of languages include
  \begin{exlist}
    \item the language of pure sets \(\lang = ∅\);

    \item the language of (reflexive) orderings \(\lang_{≤} =
    \set{\mathtt{≤}}\), where \(≤\) is a binary relation symbol;

    \item the language of groups \(\lang_{group} = \set{\mathtt{\cdot, {}^{-1};
    e}}\), where \(\mathtt{\cdot}\) is a binary function symbol,
    \(\mathtt{{}^{-1}}\) is an unary function symbol, and \(\mathtt{e}\) is a
    constant; and

    \item the language of rings with one \(\lang_{ring} = \set{\mathtt{+, -,
    \cdot; 0, 1}}\), where \(\mathtt{+, -}\) and \(\mathtt{\cdot}\) are binary
    function symbols and \(\mathtt{0, 1}\) are constants.
  \end{exlist}
\end{exam}

These languages allow for various interpretations---not all of them might be the
intended ones---and each of these interpretations is called a model. More
formally, we have the following definition.

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\lang = \set{f ∈ \mathcal{F}; R ∈ \mathcal{R}; c ∈ \mathcal{C}}\) be a
  language. A \emph{model} \(\mathfrak{A}\) of \(\lang\) is a non-empty set
  \(A\), called the \emph{universe} or \emph{carrier set} of \(\mathfrak{A}\),
  together with
  \begin{thmlist}
    \item a function \(f^{\mathfrak{A}}: A^{n_f} → A\) for every function symbols \(f ∈ \mathcal{F}\),

    \item a relation \(R^{\mathfrak{A}} \subseteq A^{n_R}\) for every relation symbols \(R ∈ \mathcal{R}\), and

    \item a constant \(c^{\mathfrak{A}} ∈ A\) for every constant constant \(c ∈ \mathcal{C}\).
  \end{thmlist}
  We will use the notation
  \[
    {\mathfrak{A}} = ⟨A; f^{\mathfrak{A}} ∈ \mathcal{F}; R^{\mathfrak{A}} ∈ \mathcal{R}; c^{\mathfrak{A}} ∈ \mathcal{C}⟩
  \]
  to denote this model.

  A model in a language without relation symbols is called \emph{algebraic
  structure}.
\end{defin}

\begin{exam}
  We list some examples of models for the languages defined above.
  \begin{exlist}
    \item In the language of pure sets \(\lang = ∅\), every non-empty set \(S\)
    gives rise to a model \(\mathfrak{S} = ⟨S⟩\).

    \item An example of model in the language of (reflexive) orderings
    \(\lang_{≤} = \set{\mathtt{≤}}\) is \(\mathfrak{N}_{≤} := ⟨ℕ, ≤⟩\), where
    \(≤\) denotes the usual ordering of the non-negative integers.

    \item As for \(\lang_{group} = \set{\mathtt{\cdot, {}^{-1}; e}}\), we can
    use any group \(G\) as a model. Indeed, consider \(\mathfrak{G} := ⟨G;
    \cdot^{\mathfrak{G}}, {\mathtt{{}^{-1}}}^{\mathfrak{G}};
    \mathtt{e}^{\mathfrak{G}}⟩\), where \(\cdot^{\mathfrak{G}}\) denotes the
    binary group-operation, \({\mathtt{{}^{-1}}}^{\mathfrak{G}}\) denotes
    inversion, and \(\mathtt{e}^{\mathfrak{G}} ∈ G\) is the neutral element of
    \(G\). However, \(\mathfrak{N}_{sg} = ⟨ℕ; +, \mathbf{0}; 0⟩\), where
    \(\mathbf{0}: ℕ → ℕ\) is defined by \(n ↦ 0\) for all \(n ∈ ℕ\), is an
    \(\lang_{group}\)-structure as well.

    \item Let \(R\) be a ring with one, then \(\mathfrak{R} := ⟨R;
    \mathtt{+^{\mathfrak{R}}, -^{\mathfrak{R}}, \cdot^{\mathfrak{R}};
    0^{\mathfrak{R}}, 1^{\mathfrak{R}}}⟩\), where \(\mathtt{+^{\mathfrak{R}},
    -^{\mathfrak{R}}, \cdot^{\mathfrak{R}}}\) are the respective binary
    ring-operations and \(\mathtt{0^{\mathfrak{R}}, 1^{\mathfrak{R}}}\) are the
    neutral elements with respect to addition or multiplication respectively, is
    a model in \(\lang_{ring}\). Of special interest to us will be the
    \(\lang_{ring}\)-structures \(\mathfrak{Z} := ⟨ ℤ; +, -, \cdot; 0, 1⟩\)
    denoting the structure of rational integers and \(\mathfrak{O}_K :=
    ⟨\algint; +, -, \cdot; 0, 1⟩\) denoting the structure of algebraic integers
    (cf.~\cref{sec:number theory}). However, we will also consider the
    \(\lang_{ring}\)-structure \(\mathfrak{N} := ⟨ℕ; +, \dotminus, \cdot; 0,
    1⟩\) of the non-negative integers, where \(\dotminus: ℕ \times ℕ → ℕ\) is
    defined by \(n \dotminus m = \max(0, n - m)\).
  \end{exlist}
\end{exam}

As a next step we want to define the syntax of formulae but at first we consider
terms.

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\lang = \set{f ∈ \mathcal{F}; R ∈ \mathcal{R}; c ∈ \mathcal{C}}\) be a
  language. The set of \emph{\(\lang\)-terms} is the smallest set \(T(\lang)\),
  such that
  \begin{thmlist}
    \item every constant symbol \(c ∈ \mathcal{C}\) is a term,

    \item every variable symbol \(\mathtt{x_i}\) is a term (\(i ∈ ℕ \setminus
    \set{0}\)), and

    \item if \(\seq[n_f]{t} ∈ T(\lang)\) are terms then \(f(\seq[n_f]{t})\) is a
    term for all function symbols \(f ∈ \mathcal{F}\).
  \end{thmlist}
\end{defin}

For example \(\mathtt{+(+(\cdot(x_1, x_1), \cdot(x_2, x_2)), 1)}\) is an
\(\lang_{ring}\) term. It is more conventional---and more legible---to write
this term in infix-notation to obtain the polynomial
\[
  \mathtt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 1},
\]
where \(\mathtt{x_i^2}\) is a short-hand notation for \(\mathtt{x_i \cdot
x_i}\). Using the very important technique of \emph{structural induction}, we
can show that every term in an \(\lang_{ring}\)-structure is a polynomial
(see~\cref{lem:terms of rings are polynomials}). In order to do this we need to
consider terms as functions. There is just a little technicality in our way,
that can be avoided by defining \(S^{0} := \set{∅}\) for every set \(S\) and
interpreting a constant \(c\) as a \(0\)-ary function \(c : S^{0} → S\).

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\lang := \set{f ∈ \mathcal{F}; R ∈ \mathcal{R}; c ∈ \mathcal{C}}\) be a
  language and let \(\mathfrak{A}\) be a model of \(\lang\) with universe \(A\).
  For a term \(t(\mathtt{\seq{x}}) ∈ T(\lang)\) that contains at most the
  variables \(\mathtt{\seq{x}}\) we define the \emph{term function}
  \(t^{\mathfrak{A}}: A^n → A\) associated to \(t(\mathtt{\seq{x}})\)
  recursively as follows:
  \begin{thmlist}
    \item If \(t(\mathtt{\seq{x}}) = c ∈ \mathcal{C}\), then
    \(t^{\mathfrak{A}}(\seq{α}) = c^{\mathfrak{A}}\) for all \(\seq{α} ∈ A\).

    % \item If \(t(\mathtt{\seq{x}}) = f(\mathtt{x_{i_1}, … x_{i_{n_f}}})\) for
    % some \(f ∈ \mathcal{F}\) and some \(\set{\seq[n_f]{i}} \subseteq \set{1, …,
    % n_f}\), then
    % \[
    %   t^{\mathfrak{A}}(\seq{α}) := f^{\mathfrak{A}}(α_{i_1}, …, α_{i_{n_f}})
    % \]
    % for all \(\seq{α} ∈ A\).

    \item If \(t(\mathtt{\seq{x}}) = \mathtt{x_i}\) for \(1 ≤ i ≤ n\), then
    \(t^{\mathfrak{A}} := π_{i}^n\) is the projection onto the \(i\)-th
    coordinate.

    \item If \(t(\mathtt{\seq{x}})\) is of the form
    \[
      t(\mathtt{\seq{x}}) = f(t_1(\mathtt{\seq{x}}), …,
      t_{n_f}(\mathtt{\seq{x}}))
    \]
    for some basic function \(f ∈ \mathcal{F}\) and some terms
    \(t_1(\mathtt{\seq{x}}), …, t_{n_f}(\mathtt{\seq{x}})\), then
    \[
      t^{\mathfrak{A}}(\seq{α}) := f^{\mathfrak{A}}(t_1^{\mathfrak{A}}(\seq{α}),
      …, t_{n_f}^{\mathfrak{A}}(\seq{α})).
    \]
  \end{thmlist}
\end{defin}

In other words, the set of term functions of a given model \(\mathfrak{A}\) is
the smallest set of functions, that contains all projections, all constants, as
well as all basic functions of \(\mathfrak{A}\), and is closed under
composition. If \(\mathfrak{A}\) is an algebraic structure, the set of term
functions of \(\mathfrak{A}\) is sometimes called the \emph{function clone} of
\(\mathfrak{A}\).

\begin{lem}\label{lem:terms of rings are polynomials}
  Let \(R\) be a ring with unit and \(\mathfrak{R}\) its associated
  \(\lang_{ring}\)-structure. The set of term functions of \(\mathfrak{R}\) is
  the set of polynomial functions with integral coefficients \(ℤ[X_1, X_2, …]\).
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Let \(t ∈ T(\lang_{ring})\) be a term. We argue by structural induction, that
  is induction on the number of symbols appearing in \(t\).
  \begin{plist}
    \item If \(t = c\) is a constant, then \(t = \zer\) or \(\one\). Both are
    constant polynomials with integral coefficients.

    \item If \(t = \mathtt{x_i}\) for some \(i ∈ ℕ \setminus \set{0}\), then
    \(t^{\mathfrak{R}} = X_i\) is a monomial.

    \item Finally, if \(t = f(t_1, t_2)\), where \(f ∈ \set{+, -, \cdot}\) and
    \(t_1, t_2\) are terms, then we can assume that \(t_1^{\mathfrak{R}}\) and
    \(t_2^{\mathfrak{R}}\) are polynomials with integral coefficients and as
    \(ℤ[X_1, X_2, …]\) is closed under sums, differences and products of
    polynomials, the term functions are indeed contained in \(ℤ[X_1, X_2, …]\)
  \end{plist}

  To see the converse inclusion note that every positive integer \(n\) can be expressed as the \(\lang_{ring}\)-term
  \[
    \underbrace{\mathtt{1 + 1 + … + 1}}_{n\text{-times}}
  \]
  and every non-positive integer \(n\) can be expressed as
  \[
    \mathtt{0 -} \underbrace{\mathtt{1 - 1 - … - 1}}_{|n|\text{-times}}.
  \]
  Then a monomial \(a X_{i_1} … X_{i_d} ∈ ℤ[X_1, X_2, …]\) with \(i_1,…,i_d ∈
  ℕ \setminus \set{0}\) not necessarily distinct can be expressed as the term
  \[
    \mathtt{a \cdot x_{i_1} \cdot … \cdot x_{i_d}},
  \]
  where \(\mathtt{a}\) is the term representing the integer \(a\). Finally,
  since every polynomial \(p\) is a finite sum of monomials \(p = m_1 + … +
  m_k\) we can find a term
  \[
    t = \mathtt{m_1 + … + m_k},
  \]
  where \(\mathtt{m_i}\) is the term representing \(m_i\) (\(1 ≤ i ≤ k\)), such
  that \(t^{\mathfrak{R}} = p\).
\end{proof}

In the lemma above I have considered the polynomial functions
\[
  p_1 : R → R, \; p_1(X_1) := X_1^2 + 1 \quad \text{and} \quad
  p_2 : R^2 → R, \; p_2(X_1, X_2) := X_1^2 + 1
\]
as the same polynomial function. This can be justified by identifying all
polynomials in \(ℤ[X_1, X_2, …]\) with functions \(p: R^ℕ → R\) depending only
on finitely many arguments.

Finally, we have all tools at hand to formally define formulae in a language.

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\lang := \set{f ∈ \mathcal{F}; R ∈ \mathcal{R}; c ∈ \mathcal{C}}\) be a
  language. We call a string \(ϕ\) \emph{atomic \(\lang\)-formula} if
  \begin{thmlist}
    \item there exist \(\lang\)-terms \(t_1, t_2\) such that \(ϕ = t_1 \doteq
    t_2\), or%
    \footnote{Note the difference between the two symbols \(=\) and \(\doteq\)
    in this equation. While \(=\) denotes a \emph{semantic} equality of strings,
    i.e. it denotes that both strings contain the same symbols in the same
    order, \(\doteq\) is just a \emph{syntactic} symbol contained in the
    strings.}

    \item there exist \(\lang\)-terms \(t_1, …, t_{n_R}\) and a relation symbol
    \(R ∈ \mathcal{R}\) such that \(ϕ = R(t_1, …, t_{n_R})\).
  \end{thmlist}

  The set of \emph{formulae} in \(\lang\) is the smallest set \(Φ(\lang)\)
  containing all atomic \(\lang\)-formulae that is closed under the following
  constructions.
  \begin{thmlist}[resume]
    \item If \(ϕ ∈ Φ(\lang)\) is a formula, so is its \emph{negation} \(¬ϕ ∈
    Φ(\lang)\).

    \item If \(ϕ_1, ϕ_2 ∈ Φ(\lang)\) are formulae, then their \emph{conjunction}
    \((ϕ_1 ∧ ϕ_2) ∈ Φ(\lang)\) is a formula.

    \item If \(ϕ(x) ∈ Φ(\lang) \) is a formula containing at least the
    variable \(x\) in one of its terms, then \(∃ x :
    ϕ(x) ∈ Φ(\lang)\) is a formula.
  \end{thmlist}

    Just for convenience we define the following abbreviations:
    \begin{thmlist}[resume]
      \item If \(ϕ_1, ϕ_2 ∈ Φ(\lang)\) are formulae, we define their
      \emph{disjunction} \((ϕ_1 ∨ ϕ_2)\) by \(¬(¬ϕ_1 ∧ ¬ϕ_2)\).

      \item If \(ϕ_1, ϕ_2 ∈ Φ(\lang)\) are formulae, then \(ϕ_1 → ϕ_2\) is short
      for \(¬(ϕ_1 ∧ ¬ ϕ_2)\).

      \item If \(ϕ(x) ∈ Φ(\lang)\) is a formula containing at least the
      variable \(x\), then we abbreviate \(¬ ∃ x: ¬
      ϕ(x)\) by \(∀ x: ϕ(x)\).
    \end{thmlist}
\end{defin}

Note that formulae as defined above are just strings and do not inherit any
meaning or truthfulness.%
\footnote{Note however, that there are formulae that are true in all models, for
instance \(\mathtt{∀ x_1 : x_1 \doteq x_1}\) is easily seen to hold in all
models.}
However, once we interpret a formula in a model, we can say whether the formula
is true or false. Let us consider some examples in the language of rings with
one.

\begin{exam}
  The following are \(\lang_{ring}\)-formulae:
  \begin{exlist}
    \item \(\mathtt{x_1 \cdot x_2 \doteq x_3}\)
    \item \(\mathtt{∃ x_2 : x_1 \cdot x_2 = 1}\)
    \item\label{ex:formula distributivity}
     \(\mathtt{∀x_1 : ∀x_2 : ∀x_3 : (x_1 + x_2) \cdot x_3 \doteq x_1 \cdot x_3 + x_2 \cdot x_3}\)
  \end{exlist}
  Intuitively, the formulae above can be interpreted as
  \begin{exlist}
    \item \(\mathtt{x_1}\) times \(\mathtt{x_2}\) equals \(\mathtt{x_3}\),
    \item \(\mathtt{x_1}\) is invertible with inverse \(\mathtt{x_2}\), and
    \item the ring operations satisfy the distributivity condition.
  \end{exlist}
\end{exam}

In the formulae of the previous example one technical obstacle becomes apparent.
While the formula of \cref{ex:formula distributivity} is either true or false in
a given \(\lang_{ring}\)-structure, the formulae in (1) and (2) depend on the
choice of elements for \(\mathtt{x_1, x_2}\) and \(\mathtt{x_3}\). For this
reason we must distinguish between two kinds of appearances of variables.

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\mathtt{x_i}\) be a variable (\(i ∈ ℕ \setminus \set{0} \)) and let
  \(ϕ\) be a formula containing \(\mathtt{x_i}\). If \(ϕ\) contains \(\mathtt{∃
  x_i} : ψ(\mathtt{x_i})\) as a sub-formula for some formula \(ψ\), we call this
  appearance of \(\mathtt{x_i}\) \emph{bound appearance}. All appearances of
  \(\mathtt{x_i}\) that are not of this shape are called \emph{free
  appearances}.
\end{defin}

In \cref{ex:formula distributivity} all appearances of \(\mathtt{x_1, x_2}\) and
\(\mathtt{x_3}\) are bound. In (2) variable \(\mathtt{x_2}\) appears bounded
way while \(\mathtt{x_1}\) is free and in (1) all variables appear freely. For a
formula \(ϕ\) we will write \(ϕ(\mathtt{\seq{x}})\) to emphasize that at most
the variables \(\mathtt{\seq{x}}\) appear freely in \(ϕ\).

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\lang\) be a language and let \(\mathfrak{A}\) be model of \(\lang\)
  with universe \(A\). For a formula \(ϕ = ϕ(\mathtt{\seq{x}})\) and elements
  \(\seq{α} ∈ A\) we say \(ϕ(\seq{α})\) is \emph{true} in \(\mathfrak{A}\) or
  \(\mathfrak{A}\) \emph{models} \(ϕ(\seq{α})\) and write
  \[
    \mathfrak{A} \models ϕ(\seq{α})
  \]
  if the following recursively defined conditions are met.
  \begin{thmlist}
    \item If \(ϕ = t_1 \doteq t_2\) for two terms \(t_1, t_2\), then
    \(\mathfrak{A} \models ϕ(\seq{α})\) if
    \[
      t_1^{\mathfrak{A}}(\seq{α}) = t_2^{\mathfrak{A}}(\seq{α}).
    \]

    \item If \(ϕ = R(t_1, …, t_{n_R})\) for a relation symbol \(R\) and terms
    \(t_1, …, t_{n_R}\), then \(\mathfrak{A} \models ϕ(\seq{α})\) if
    \[
      R^{\mathfrak{A}}(t_1^{\mathfrak{A}}(\seq{α}), …,
       t_{n_R}^{\mathfrak{A}}(\seq{α})).
    \]

    \item If \(ϕ = ¬ ψ\) for a formula \(ψ\), then \(\mathfrak{A} \models
    ϕ(\seq{α})\) if \(\mathfrak{A} \models ψ(\seq{α})\) does not hold.

    \item If \(ϕ = (ψ_1 ∧ ψ_2)\) for two formulae \(ψ_1, ψ_2\), then
    \(\mathfrak{A} \models ϕ(\seq{α})\) if both \(\mathfrak{A} \models
    ψ_1(\seq{α})\) and \(\mathfrak{A} \models ψ_2(\seq{α})\) hold.

    \item If \(ϕ(\mathtt{\seq{x}}) = ∃ x : ψ(x, \mathtt{\seq{x}})\),
    then \(\mathfrak{A} \models ϕ(\seq{α})\) if there exists an \(α ∈ A\) such
    that \(\mathfrak{A} \models ψ(α, \seq{α})\).
  \end{thmlist}
\end{defin}

\begin{rem}
  \begin{exlist}
    \item I leave it as an exercise to check that our abbreviations \(∨, →\)
    and \(∀\) have their intended interpretation of \emph{disjunction},
    \emph{implication} and \emph{universal quantification}.

    \item Note that variables can have both free \emph{and} bound appearances in
    the same formula, e.g. \(\mathtt{x_2}\) in
    \[
      \mathtt{(∃ x_2 : x_1 \cdot x_2 \doteq x_2) ∧ (x_2 + x_3 \doteq x_1)}.
    \]
    By the definition of what it means that a formula is true in a model, we can
    restrict our attention to formulae, such that all variables appear
    \emph{either} freely \emph{or} bounded but not both, and if a variable
    appears bound, then it is bound by a single quantifier. It is easy to check
    that the formula above is true in a model if and only if the following
    formula is true
    \[
      \mathtt{(∃ x_2 : x_1 \cdot x_2 \doteq x_2) ∧ (x_4 + x_3 \doteq x_1)}.
    \]
    Variables that appear freely in a formula are also called \emph{free
    variables.}
  \end{exlist}
\end{rem}

A formula without free variables is called a \emph{sentence}. In a fixed model a
sentence is either true or false. This follows easily form the definition of
truth in a model.

In this section I introduce some very important notions from model theory and
universal algebra. I start with the concept of \emph{morphism}. The reader
should already have encountered morphisms in basic lectures on abstract algebra.
They are just mappings that respect the basic operations of structures. More
formally, one defines a morphism as follows.

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\lang := \set{f ∈ \mathcal{F}; R ∈ \mathcal{R}; c ∈ \mathcal{C}}\) be a
  language and \(\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{B}\) two models in \(\lang\) with
  universes \(A\) and \(B\) respectively. A function \(φ : A → B\) is called
  \emph{\(\lang\)-morphism} if
  \begin{thmlist}
    \item \(φ(f^{\mathfrak{A}}(\seq[n_f]{α})) = f^{\mathfrak{B}}(φ(α_1), …,
    φ(α_{n_f}))\) holds for all \(f ∈ \mathcal{F}\) and all \(\seq[n_f]{α} ∈
    A\);

    \item \(R^{\mathfrak{A}} (\seq[n_R]{α})\) implies
    \(R^{\mathfrak{B}}(φ(α_1), …, φ(α_{n_r}))\) for all \(R ∈ \mathcal{R}\) and
    all \(\seq[n_R]{α} ∈ A\); and

    \item \(φ(c^{\mathfrak{A}}) = c^{\mathfrak{B}}\) for all \(c ∈
    \mathcal{C}\).
  \end{thmlist}
\end{defin}

\begin{rem}
  Despite the similarity of the definition of \(\lang_{ring}\)-morphisms to
  ring-morphisms in the sense of abstract algebra, not every
  \(\lang_{ring}\)-morphism is ring-morphism and vice versa. Consider for
  example the identity \(\mathrm{id}_ℕ\) on the \(\lang_{ring}\)-structure
  \(\mathfrak{N}\). As \(ℕ\) is not a ring in the sense of abstract algbera,
  \(\mathrm{id}_ℕ\) is not a ring-morphism, but it is clearly an
  \(\lang_{ring}\)-morphism.

  On the other hand, the mapping \(φ: ℤ → ℤ \times ℤ\) defined by
  \[
    φ(α) = (0, α)
  \]
  is a ring-morphism that is not a \(\lang_{ring}\)-morphism, as \(1\) is not
  mapped to the neutral element \((1, 1)\) in \(ℤ \times ℤ\).
\end{rem}

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\lang\) be a language.
  \begin{thmlist}
    \item A set of \(\lang\)-sentences is called an \emph{\(\lang\)-theory}.

    \item Let \(\mathfrak{A}\) be a model in \(\lang\). We say \(\mathfrak{A}\)
    satisfies a theory \(T\) and write \(\mathfrak{A} \models T\) if
    \(\mathfrak{A} \models ϕ\) for all \(ϕ ∈ T\).

    \item A class of models \(\mathcal{M}\) in \(\lang\) is called
    \emph{elementary class} if there exists an \(\lang\)-theory \(T\) such that
    for all models
    \(\mathfrak{A}\) the following equivalence holds
    \[
      \mathfrak{A} ∈ \mathcal{M} \quad ⇔ \quad \mathfrak{A} \models T.
    \]

    \item An elementary class \(\mathcal{V}\) of algebraic structures is called
    \emph{universal variety}, if the defining theory \(T\) does only include
    universally quantified atomic formulae.
  \end{thmlist}
\end{defin}

\begin{exam}
  The class of groups forms a universal variety with respect to
  \(\lang_{group}\). This is the case since the group axioms
  \begin{clist}
    \item \(\mathtt{∀ x_1 : x_1 \cdot e \doteq x_1}\),
    \item \(\mathtt{∀ x_1 : e \cdot x_1 \doteq x_1}\),
    \item \(\mathtt{∀ x_1 : ∀ x_2 : ∀ x_3 : (x_1 \cdot x_2) \cdot x_3 \doteq x_1 \cdot (x_2 \cdot x_3)}\), and
    \item \(\mathtt{∀ x_1 : x_1 \cdot x_1^{-1} \doteq e}\)
    \item \(\mathtt{∀ x_1 : x_1^{-1} \cdot x_1 \doteq e}\)
  \end{clist}
  characterize groups completely. Another example of a universal variety are
  rings with one. Note however, that fields do not form a universal variety with
  respect to \(\lang_{ring}\) as we demand that elements unequal to \(0\) are
  invertible which can be expressed by the sentence
  \[
    ∀ x_1 : (¬ x_1 \doteq 0) → (∃ x_2 : x_1 \cdot x_2 \doteq 1)
  \]
  containing both universal and existential quantifiers.
\end{exam}

Universal varieties are useful, as substructures can be characterized by
embeddings, e.g.\ we have that a subset \(S\) of a ring with one \(R\) is a
sub-ring, if and only if \(S\) carries a \(\lang_{ring}\)-structure
\(\mathfrak{S}\) such that the embedding
\[
  ι: S → R, \quad ι(α) = α
\]
is an \(\lang_{ring}\)-morphism between \(\mathfrak{S}\) and the
\(\lang_{ring}\)-structure of \(\mathfrak{R}\). Moreover, we have the following
important result.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:elementary equivalence}
  Let \(\mathfrak{A}\) and \(\mathfrak{B}\) be two \(\lang\)-structures, with
  universe \(A\) and \(B\) respectively, and let \(φ: A → B\) be a bijective
  \(\lang\)-morphism. Then \(\mathfrak{A}\) and \(\mathfrak{B}\) are
  \emph{elementary equivalent} i.e.\ for all \(\lang\)-sentences
  \(ϕ\), \(\mathfrak{A} \models ϕ\) if and only if \(\mathfrak{B} \models ϕ\).
\end{thm}

A proof of the theorem using induction on the structure of formulae can be found
in \cite[Thm~1.1.10]{Marker2002}. To conclude this section we describe theories
of special importance to our task of settling Hilbert's tenth problem and define
what it means to decide a theory.

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\lang\) be a language and let \(\mathfrak{A}\) be a model with universe
  \(A\) in \(\lang\).
  \begin{thmlist}
    \item The \emph{full theory of \(\mathfrak{A}\)} is the the set
    \[
      \mathtt{Th}(\mathfrak{A}) :=
        \set{ϕ ∈ Φ(\lang) \mid \mathfrak{A} \models ϕ}
    \]
    of all sentences true in \(\mathfrak{A}\).

    \item The \emph{purely Diophantine theory of \(\mathfrak{A}\)} is the set
    \[
      \mathtt{H10}^*(\mathfrak{A}) :=
        \set{ϕ ∈ Φ(\lang) \mid
        ϕ = \mathtt{∃ x_{i_1} : … ∃ x_{i_k} : }ψ(\mathtt{x_{i_1}, …, x_{i_k}}),
        ψ \text{ is atomic, and } \mathfrak{A} \models ϕ}
    \]
    of all fully existentially quantified atomic formulae that are satisfied by
    \(\mathfrak{A}\).

    \item The \emph{primitive positive theory of \(\mathfrak{A}\)} is the set
    \[
      \mathtt{Th}_{∃+}(\mathfrak{A}) :=
        \set{ϕ ∈ Φ(\lang) \;\middle\vert \substack{
          {ϕ = \mathtt{∃ x_{i_1} : … ∃ x_{i_k} : }
          \bigwedge_{j = 1}^m ψ_j(\mathtt{x_{i_1}, …, x_{i_k}}),}\\
        {ψ_j \text{ is atomic, and } \mathfrak{A} \models ϕ}}}
    \]
    of all fully existentially quantified conjunctions of atomic formulae that
    are satisfied by \(\mathfrak{A}\).
  \end{thmlist}
\end{defin}

Let us take a look at some examples to get a better understanding of these
abstract definitions.

\begin{exam}
  \begin{exlist}
    \item Let \(\mathfrak{Q} := ⟨ℚ; +, -, \cdot; 0, 1⟩\) be the
    \(\lang_{ring}\)-structure of the rationals. Then
    \[
      \mathfrak{Q} \models \mathtt{∀ x_1 : (¬ x_1 \doteq 0) → (∃ x_2 : x_1 \cdot x_2 \doteq 1)}
    \]
    and therefore this sentence is contained in \(\mathtt{Th}(\mathfrak{Q})\).
    However, \(2 ∈ ℤ \setminus \set{0}\) is not invertible in \(ℤ\). Thus, the
    sentence is not in \(\mathtt{Th}(\mathfrak{Z})\).

    \item Consider \(ϕ := \mathtt{∃ x_1 : x_1^2 + 1 \doteq 0}\). Then \(ϕ\) can
    be satisfied by the witness \(i ∈ ℂ\) in \(\mathfrak{C} := ⟨ ℂ; +, -, \cdot;
    0, 1⟩\) as \(i^2 + 1 = 0\) holds in \(\mathfrak{C}\). Thus, \(ϕ ∈
    \mathtt{Th}_∃(\mathfrak{C})\). But the sentence is not contained in
    \(\mathtt{Th}_{∃}(\mathfrak{Z})\).

    \item Consider the directed graph \(\mathfrak{G} := ⟨\set{1, 2, 3, 4}; E⟩\)
    below.
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics{res/digraph}
    \end{center}
    Here \(E\) denotes the binary adjacency relation, where e.g. \(E(1,
    2)\) holds but \(E(2, 1)\) does not. The following sentence intuitively says
    that a graph contains a cycle of length \(3\).
    \[
      ϕ := \mathtt{∃ x_1 : ∃ x_2 : ∃ x_3 :
           (E(x_1, x_2) ∧ E(x_2, x_3) ∧ E(x_3, x_1))}
    \]

    Using \(1\) as witness for \(\mathtt{x_1}\) and \(2, 4\) as witnesses for
    \(\mathtt{x_2}, \mathtt{x_3}\), we obtain that \(ϕ ∈
    \mathtt{Th}_{∃+}(\mathfrak{G})\). It is not difficult to find a directed
    graph that does not model \(ϕ\).
  \end{exlist}
\end{exam}

While we can already state a lot of properties in the languages we have
considered so far, we can for instance not formulate a sentence in the language
\(\lang_{ring}\) that says a specific polynomial has a root. Take for instance
the ring structure \(\mathfrak{C}\) of \(ℂ\), we cannot formulate a sentence
that says the polynomial \(X^2 - i ∈ ℂ[X]\) has a root over \(ℂ\). To get around
this limitation we define \emph{diagrams}.

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\lang\) be a language and \(\mathfrak{A}\) a model in \(\lang\) with
  universe \(A\). We define the \(A\)-language as
  \[
    \lang_A := \lang ∪ \set{\mathtt{c}_α \mid α ∈ A}
  \]
  the union of \(\lang\) and a constant symbol for each element of \(A\).
\end{defin}

Clearly, \(\mathfrak{A}\) is also a model in \(\lang_A\) by additionally
interpreting \(\mathtt{c}_a^{\mathfrak{A}} := a\) for all \(a ∈ A\).

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\lang\) be a language and let \(\mathfrak{A}\) be a model with universe
  \(A\) in \(\lang\). We define the following \(\lang_A\)-theories.
  \begin{thmlist}
    \item The \emph{complete diagram} of \(\mathfrak{A}\) is the the set
    \[
      D^c(\mathfrak{A}) :=
        \set{ϕ ∈ Φ(\lang_A) \mid \mathfrak{A} \models ϕ}
    \]
    of all \(\lang_A\)-sentences true in \(\mathfrak{A}\).

    \item The \emph{Diophantine theory} of \(\mathfrak{A}\) is the set
    \[
      \mathtt{H10}(\mathfrak{A}) :=
        \set{ϕ ∈ Φ(\lang_A) \mid
        ϕ = \mathtt{∃ x_{i_1} : … ∃ x_{i_k} : }ψ(\mathtt{x_{i_1}, …, x_{i_k}}),
        ψ \text{ is atomic, and } \mathfrak{A} \models ϕ}
    \]
    of all fully existentially quantified atomic \(\lang_A\)-formulae that are
    satisfied by \(\mathfrak{A}\).

    \item The \emph{primitive positive diagram} of \(\mathfrak{A}\) is the set
    \[
      D_{∃+}(\mathfrak{A}) :=
        \set{ϕ ∈ Φ(\lang) \;\middle\vert\; \substack{
          {ϕ = \mathtt{∃ x_{i_1} : … ∃ x_{i_k} : }
          \bigwedge_{j = 1}^m ψ_j(\mathtt{x_{i_1}, …, x_{i_k}}),}\\
        {ψ_j \text{ is atomic, and } \mathfrak{A} \models ϕ}}}
    \]
    of all full existentially quantified conjunctions of atomic
    \(\lang_A\)-formulae that are satisfied by \(\mathfrak{A}\).

    \item The \emph{atomic diagram} of \(\mathfrak{A}\) is the set
    \[
      D(\mathfrak{A}) :=
        \set{ϕ ∈ Φ(\lang_A) \;\middle\vert\; \substack{
          {\text{there exists an atomic formula } ψ \text{ with }}\\
          {ϕ = ψ \text{, or } ϕ = ¬ ψ \text{ and }
           \mathfrak{A} \models ϕ}}
        }
    \]
    of all atomic \(\lang_A\)-sentences and negations of atomic
    \(\lang_A\)-sentences that are satisfied by \(\mathfrak{A}\).
  \end{thmlist}
\end{defin}

Of special interest to us is the Diophantine theory of rings with one. The name
can be justified by the following lemma.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:Diophantine theory}
  Let \(R\) be a ring with one and let \(\mathfrak{R}\) be its
  \(\lang_{ring}\)-structure.
  \begin{thmlist}
    \item The set of term functions associated to \(\lang_R\)-terms is the set
    of polynomial functions \(R[X_1, X_2, …]\)

    \item Let \(\mathtt{P} \subseteq Φ(\lang_R)\) be the set of all
    existentially quantified atomic \(\lang_R\)-formulae. There exists a
    surjection
    \[
      π: \mathtt{P} → R[X_1, X_2, …]
    \]
    Such that for all sentences \(ϕ ∈ \mathtt{P}\) we have
    \[
      ϕ ∈ \mathtt{H10}(\mathfrak{R}) \quad ⇔ \quad
      π(p) \text{ has roots over } R
    \]
  \end{thmlist}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  \begin{plist}
    \item Let \(t\) be an \(\lang_R\)-term. One proves completely analogously as
    in the proof of \cref{lem:terms of rings are polynomials}, that
    \(t^{\mathfrak{R}} ∈ R[X_1, X_2, …]\) is a polynomial function. The only
    difference is that constants now range over all of \(R\) instead of
    \(\set{0, 1}\) thus yielding the different coefficients.

    To see the converse inclusion we note that monomials \(α X_{i_1} X_{i_d} ∈
    R[X_1, X_2]\), with \(\set{\seq[d]{i}} \subseteq ℕ \setminus \set{0}\) not
    necessarily distinct, correspond to terms
    \[
      \mathtt{c}_α \cdot \mathtt{x_{i_1} \cdot … \cdot x_{i_d}}.
    \]
    Since every polynomial \(p\) is a finite sum of monomials we obtain a term
    representing \(p\) by joining the terms representing the monomials by a
    \(\mathtt{+}\) symbol.

    \item Let \(ϕ ∈ \mathtt{P}\) be a sentence. By definition of \(\mathtt{P}\)
    there exists an atomic \(\lang_{R}\)-formula \(ψ\) such that
    \[
      ϕ = \mathtt{∃ x_{i_1} : … ∃ x_{i_k} : } ψ(\mathtt{x_{i_1}, …, x_{i_k}}).
    \]
    Since \(\lang_{R}\) contains no relation symbols, all atomic
    \(\lang_{R}\)-formulae are identities of terms. Thus, there exist terms
    \(t_1, t_2\) such that
    \[
      ψ = t_1 \doteq t_2.
    \]
    By part (i) of the theorem the term functions \(t_1^{\mathfrak{R}}\) and
    \(t_2^{\mathfrak{R}}\) are polynomial functions in \(R[X_1, X_2, …]\). We
    set \(π(ϕ) := t_1^{\mathfrak{R}} - t_2^{\mathfrak{R}}\).

    To see that \(π\) is surjective let \(p ∈ R[X_1, X_2, …]\) be a polynomial.
    Then by (i) there exists a term \(t\) such that \(t^{\mathfrak{R}} = p\).
    Now set
    \[
      ϕ := \mathtt{∃ x_{i_1} : … ∃ x_{i_k} : } t(\mathtt{x_{i_1}, …, x_{i_k})
        \doteq 0},
    \]
    where \(\mathtt{x_{i_1}, …, x_{i_k}}\) are all variable symbols appearing in
    \(t\). Then \(π(ϕ) = p\) as claimed.

    Let now \(ϕ ∈ \mathtt{H10}(\mathfrak{R})\) be a sentence that is true in
    \(\mathfrak{R}\). By the discussion above we find that
    \[
      ϕ := \mathtt{∃ x_{i_1} : … ∃ x_{i_k} : }
        t_1(\mathtt{x_{i_1}, …, x_{i_k}}) \doteq
        t_2(\mathtt{x_{i_1}, …, x_{i_k}}),
    \]
    for some \(\lang_R\)-terms \(t_1, t_2\). Using the definition of truth in a
    model this is the case if and only if there exist elements \(α_{i_1}, …,
    α_{i_k} ∈ R\) such that
    \[
      t_1^{\mathfrak{R}}(α_{i_1}, …, α_{i_k}) =
      t_2^{\mathfrak{R}}(α_{i_1}, …, α_{i_k}).
    \]
    Which is the true if and only if \(π(ϕ) = t_1 - t_2\) has roots over \(R\).
  \end{plist}
\end{proof}

To finish our last task of this section we have to overcome once more a
technical difficulty: If we want to define what it means to \emph{decide} a
theory, we must identify the theory with subsets of \(ω\). To this end
\textcite{Goedel1931} introduced a method that is today commonly known as
\emph{Gödelization}.

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\lang\) be an at most countable language and let
  \[
    i: \lang ∪ \set{\doteq, \mathtt{¬, ∧, ∃, :, (, ), x, '}}
    → ℕ \setminus \set{0}
  \]
  be an injective function such that \(i(s) > 9\) for all \(s ∈ \lang\) and the
  image of \(i\) is an initial segment of the usual order of \(ℕ \setminus
  \set{0}\).

  The \emph{Gödel number} \(\mathrm{gn}(ϕ)\) of a formula \(ϕ ∈ Φ(\lang)\) is
  obtained by first replacing every variable symbol \(\mathtt{x_j}\) in \(ϕ\) by
  the string
  \[
    \mathtt{x}\overbrace{\mathtt{'…'}}^{j\text{-times}}.
  \]
  Say the resulting string is
  \[
    \mathbf{s} = s_1 s_2 … s_n
  \]
  where \(s_i\) is a symbol contained in \(\lang ∪ \set{\doteq, \mathtt{¬, ∧,
  ∃, (, ), x, '}}\) then
  \[
    \mathrm{gn}(ϕ) := p_1^{i(s_1)} p_2^{i(s_2)} … p_n^{i(s_n)},
  \]
  where \(p_i ∈ ℕ\) is the \(i\)-th prime.
\end{defin}

By the uniqueness of the prime factorization in \(ℕ\), two different formulae
cannot have the same Gödel number. Finally, one obtains an encoding
\(\enc{\cdot}: Φ(\lang) → ω\) by composing \(\mathrm{gn}\) with an encoding of
the natural numbers (cf.~\cref{ex:omega encoding})

\begin{exam}
To get a feeling for how fast the Gödel numbers grow let us consider the
Gödelization of the following \(\lang_{ring}\)-formula
\[
  \mathtt{∃ x_1 : x_1 \doteq 0}.
\]
We choose the function \(i\) as described in the table below.
\[
  \begin{array}{l r r r r r r r r r r r r r r}
    \toprule
    s & \doteq & ¬ & ∧ & ∃ & : & ( & ) & \mathtt{x} & ' & + & - & \cdot & \mathtt{0} & \mathtt{1}\\
    i(s) & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{array}
\]
Using the notation from the definition we obtain
\[
  \mathbf{s} = ∃ x' : x' \doteq 0
\]
yielding the Gödel number
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{gn}(ϕ) &= 2^4 3^8 5^9 7^5 11^8 13^9 17^1 19^{13},
\end{align*}
which already has \(52\) decimal digits.
\end{exam}

\begin{defin}
  Let \(\lang\) be an at most countable language. An \(\lang\)-theory \(T\) is
  \emph{decidable} (\emph{semi-decidable}) if the set
  \[
    \set{\enc{ϕ} \mid ϕ ∈ T}
  \]
  is decidable (semi-decidable).
\end{defin}

\begin{rem}
  Let \(\mathfrak{A}\) be model. If we order the theories defined above by
  set-inclusion, the interrelations depicted in the following diagram hold.
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{res/theories}
  \end{center}
  If the language and the universe of \(\mathfrak{A}\) are at most countable
  then we can Gödelize these theories and identify them with their set of Gödel
  numbers. The identity \(\id: ω → ω\) will then witness many-one reducibility
  of subsets to supersets e.g.\ \(D(\mathfrak{A}) ≤_m D^c(\mathfrak{A})\) holds.

  Concerning rings of algebraic integers (incl. \(ℤ\)), we will see that
  \(\mathtt{Th}_{∃+}(\mathfrak{A})\) is many-one reducible to
  \(\mathtt{H10}^*(\mathfrak{A})\) and that \(D_{∃+}(\mathfrak{A})\) is many-one
  reducible to \(\mathtt{H10}^*(\mathfrak{A})\) (see~\cref{lem:intersections and
  unions}). In order to settle Hilbert's tenth problem we will show for some
  rings of algebraic integers that the halting set \(\mathcal{K}\) is many-one
  reducible to \(D_{∃+}(\mathfrak{A})\) and vice versa. Thus, with
  respect to many-one reducibility we obtain the following interrelations
  between the theories.
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{res/theories_2}

\end{rem}
