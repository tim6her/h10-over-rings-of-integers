\section{Collected \emph{Haskell} implementations}

\subsection{Polynomials} \label{app:polynomials}

The following listings show a \emph{Haskell} implemantation of the monoid of
monomials and the algbera of polynomials in countably indeterminates. Note that
the axioms of monoids and algebras respectively are only heuristically verified
but not formally proven.
